We reviewed our layout and changed all the locations from 306 tests to our own and changed names/symbols to be our own as well.

We also added a check that there were 9 room types by checking for 9 center cells on the board.

For door facing left we chose the Mess Hall door as it clearly faces left
For right facing we chose docking bay as it is a prominent right facing door
For down we chose armory as it has a down door
for up we chose armory as well as it also has an up door

For room types we selected a few random rooms from our own list and modified locations accordingly.

We chose the captain's quarters to trash compactor as our secret passage because it seemed like the most fun one.
