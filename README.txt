IMPORTANT: To run the test of our Clue Cards GUI, please use the main method in CardsDisplayPanel.java

List of new classes for the C21A-2 Clue Cards GUI:
- CardsDisplayPanel.java //Generates the main display panel
- CardTypePanel.java	 //Generates a panel for one of the 3 card types; people, rooms, or weapons
- CardStatusPanel.java	 //Generates a panel representing either hand cards or seen cards
- StatusCategory.java	 //An enum class with two value options: HAND and SEEN

We also implemented the bonus requirement to indicate which player is holding the seen card via color.
